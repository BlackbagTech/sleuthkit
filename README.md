# This fork is no longer being actively maintained

Thank you for your interest in BlackBag's APFS implementation to The Sleuth kit.  We're happy to announce that work has begun on merging this work into the upstream sleuthkit project.  Rather than maintaining an ever-diverging fork, weâ€™ll be submitting all future fixes and enhancements as pull requests to the upstream project.

For APFS support, we encourage you to check out and compile the [upstream apfs branch](https://github.com/sleuthkit/sleuthkit/tree/apfs) and submit all bug reports to their issue tracker.
